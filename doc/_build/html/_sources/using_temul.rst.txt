.. _using_temul:

Getting started
---------------

There are many aspects to the TEMUL Toolkit, such as polarisation analysis,
element quantification, and automatic image simulation (through pyprismatic).

(coming soon) These each have their own dedicated pages, which can be found in the table of contents.

For now, see the :ref:`api_doc`.
