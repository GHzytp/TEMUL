# TEMUL
Functions for image and signal processing, based on the packages Scikit-image, Hyperspy, Atomap, PyPrismatic, ASE, periodictable etc. Written by members of the TEMUL group from the University of Limerick, Ireland (though we welcome all help, hints and contributions!)

## How to Install
The easiest way to use this suite of functions is to place the TEMUL/temul folder into your Python packages directory. In an Anaconda installation, this can be found at "anaconda3/Lib/site-packages". 
1.  Click on the green "Clone or Download" button. Use git clone https://github.com/PinkShnack/TEMUL.git or Download ZIP to download the TEMUL package.
2. Navigate into the TEMUL folder, copy the "temul" folder.
3. Navigate to your python packages directory and paste "temul" there.
4. Open Anaconda prompt and type python. Type "import temul". If no error occurs, type "temul", which should show the directory in which you just pasted the temul folder.
